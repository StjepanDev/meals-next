          Following are the key features of Next.js. Hot Code Reload − Next.js
          server detects modified files and reloads them automatically.
          Automatic Routing − No need to configure any url for routing. files
          are to be placed in pages folder. All urls will be mapped to file
          system. Customization can be done. Component specific styles −
          styled-jsx provides support for global as well as component specific
          styles. Server side rendering − react components are prerendered on
          server hence loads faster on client. Node Ecosystem − Next.js being
          react based gels well with Node ecosystem. Automatic code split −

          it. Prefetch − Next.js provides Link component which is used to link

          application. Built-in Typescript Support − Next.js is written in
